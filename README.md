# Clinical Trial Streamlining Application

This application aims to streamline the clinical trial process by leveraging the ClinicalTrials.gov API to allow prospective patients to search for studies. The primary objectives of the app are to enhance communication, improve patient retention, and extract data for training AI models to detect points of failure in the clinical trial process.
Additionally, through data preprocessing, the app aims to provide a clean dataset where keywords are stored for the training of Natural Language Processing algorithms.
## Technologies Used:

- **Flutter/Dart:** The application is developed using the Flutter framework with Dart programming language, allowing for cross-platform development of mobile applications.

- **ClinicalTrials.gov API:** This API provides access to a comprehensive database of clinical trials, enabling users to search for relevant studies based on various criteria such as condition, location, and intervention.

- **Postman:** Postman is utilized for testing and interacting with the ClinicalTrials.gov API endpoints during development to ensure proper integration and functionality.
